        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of this site is to demonstrate a really cool piece of software I have been
          working on in my spare time and most of this last summer. I am not ready to launch or
          reveal publicly yet, but I want to have a site ready to go when I am.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          The primary audience for this project will be people who like automation and AI—ideally,
          people who would like to free up their time by removing mundane tasks.
        </p>

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript will power an interactive “Idea Board” and a “Feature Spotlight” gallery. An ES
          module will export an array of idea objects (with fields such as title, type, description,
          and upvoteCount) and another array of example “demo features” that represent safe,
          high-level capabilities of the software. A main module will import this data and render it
          into cards on the page using DOM manipulation and template functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitors will be able to filter ideas by type (Feature, Bug, Integration, Other) and sort
          them by newest or highest upvotes using array methods like <code>filter</code>,
          <code>sort</code>, and <code>map</code>. Each idea card will include an “Upvote” button
          that increments the upvote count in the underlying object and re-renders the card. A
          simple form will let users add new ideas for this session only; submitted ideas will be
          pushed into the ideas array and displayed immediately. Conditional logic will show a
          friendly message if no ideas match the current filters and will highlight “Popular” ideas
          (for example, any item with more than 5 upvotes).
        </p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>

        <h3>Website Logo</h3>
        <p>
          The final logo direction is a simple, professional, single-stroke robot mark that scales
          well. The icon will typically use the primary color, with the wordmark in the dark accent
          color (or white when placed on a dark background).
        </p>

          src="images/Mylogo2.png"

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>
          Palette URL:
          <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-b5983e-2b1c2c-aaaabb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            https://coolors.co/396e94-b5983e-2b1c2c-aaaabb
          </a>
        </p>

        <table class="colors">
          <tr>
            <th>Primary</th>
            <th>Secondary</th>
            <th>Accent 1</th>
            <th>Accent 2</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="primary">#396E94</td>
            <td class="secondary">#B5983E</td>
            <td class="accent1">#2B1C2C</td>
            <td class="accent2">#AAAABB</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: IM Fell French Canon SC</h4>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Lato</h4>
        <p>
          IM Fell French Canon SC gives the headings a distinctive, slightly formal look that helps
          Really Cool Software feel like a serious, well-crafted tool. Lato is a clean, modern
          sans-serif font that is easy to read for body text on both desktop and mobile, which is
          important for longer explanations and idea descriptions on the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
        <p class="colored">
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
          ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation

        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
          The home page will introduce Really Cool Software at a high level without revealing all
          of its internal details. It will explain that this is a desktop assistant project focused
          on automation, but emphasize that the site is a preview and idea hub rather than a full
          product launch.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A hero section with the project name, a short tagline, and a brief paragraph.</li>
          <li>
            A “Feature Spotlight” area that uses JavaScript to display a small set of safe,
            high-level example capabilities from a features array.
          </li>
          <li>
            A simple overview of how visitors can participate: reading the roadmap, submitting
            ideas, and upvoting suggestions on the Idea Board.
          </li>
          <li>
            At least one image that represents software, automation, or a clean desktop workspace,
            plus the site logo.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Idea Board (Page 2)</h3>
        <p>
          The Idea Board page will be the main interactive part of the site where visitors can view
          and interact with example ideas and feature suggestions related to Really Cool Software.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A short introduction explaining this is a preview space for collecting ideas.</li>
          <li>
            Filters to select idea type (Feature, Bug, Integration, Other) and sorting by newest or
            highest upvotes using array methods like <code>filter</code> and <code>sort</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            A dynamically generated list of idea cards from an array of objects; clicking “Upvote”
            increases <code>upvoteCount</code> and updates the UI.
          </li>
          <li>A form that adds new ideas for this session only and re-renders the list.</li>
          <li>
            Conditional messages (e.g., “No ideas match your filters”) and a “Popular” highlight for
            ideas above a threshold.
          </li>
          <li>
            At least one relevant image/icon that symbolizes brainstorming, collaboration, or
            feature requests.
          </li>
        </ul>
