			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to demonstrate a really cool piece of software I have
				been working on in my spare time and most of this last summer. I am not ready to 
				launch or really reveal publicly yet but I want to have a site ready to go when I 
				am.</p>
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The primary audience for this project will be people who like automation and AI.
			   Ideally people who would like to free up their time by removing their mundane tasks. </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				JavaScript will power an interactive “Idea Board” and a “Feature Spotlight”
				gallery. An ES module will export an array of idea objects (with fields such
				as title, type, description, and upvoteCount) and another array of example
				“demo features” that represent safe, high-level capabilities of the software.
				A main module will import this data and render it into cards on the page using
				DOM manipulation and template functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Visitors will be able to filter ideas by type (Feature, Bug, Integration,
				Other) and sort them by newest or highest upvotes using array methods like
				<code>filter</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>map</code>. Each idea card
				will include an “Upvote” button that increments the upvote count in the
				underlying object and re-renders the card. A simple form will let users add
				new ideas for this session only; submitted ideas will be pushed into the ideas
				array and displayed immediately. Conditional logic will show a friendly
				message if no ideas match the current filters and will highlight “Popular”
				ideas (for example, any item with more than 5 upvotes).
			</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/396e94-B5983F-2b1c2c-aaaabb"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/396e94-B5983F-2b1c2c-aaaabb</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
					<td class="primary">#396E94</td>
					<td class="secondary">#B5983E</td>
					<td class="accent1">#2B1C2C</td>
					<td class="accent2">#AAAABB</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				<h4>Heading Font: IM Fell French Canon SC</h4>
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				<h4>Paragraph Font: Lato</h4>
			</h4>
			<p>
			IM Fell French Canon SC gives the headings a distinctive, slightly formal
			look that helps Really Cool Software feel like a serious, well-crafted tool.
			Lato is a clean, modern sans-serif font that is easy to read for body text
			on both desktop and mobile, which is important for the longer explanations
			and idea descriptions on the site.
			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
			tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
			veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
			commodo consequat.
			</p>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
			<a href="#">Home</a>
			<a href="#">Idea Board</a>
			<a href="#">Roadmap</a>
			</nav>
			<hr />

			<h2>Content</h2>

			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>
			The home page will introduce Really Cool Software at a high level without
			revealing all of its internal details. It will explain that this is a
			desktop assistant project focused on automation, but emphasize that the
			site is a preview and idea hub rather than a full product launch.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				A hero section with the project name, a short tagline, and a brief
				paragraph describing the vision of the software.
			</li>
			<li>
				A “Feature Spotlight” area that uses JavaScript to display a small set of
				safe, high-level example capabilities from a features array (for example:
				“Launch favorite apps”, “Organize repetitive workflows”, “Capture screen
				snippets”). This does not expose the real implementation.
			</li>
			<li>
				A simple overview of how visitors can participate: reading the roadmap,
				submitting ideas, and upvoting suggestions on the Idea Board.
			</li>
			<li>
				At least one image that represents software, automation, or a clean
				desktop workspace, plus the site logo.
			</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Idea Board (Page 2)</h3>
			<p>
				The Idea Board page will be the main interactive part of the site where
				visitors can view and interact with example ideas and feature suggestions
				related to Really Cool Software.
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				A short introduction explaining that this is a preview space for collecting
				ideas, feedback, and potential future features.
			</li>
			<li>
				A filter area that lets users filter ideas by type (Feature, Bug, Integration,
				Other) and sort them by newest or highest upvotes. These filters and sorts
				will be implemented using JavaScript array methods like
				<code>filter</code> and <code>sort</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
				A dynamically generated list of idea cards created from an array of objects
				(each idea having properties such as title, type, description, and
				upvoteCount). Clicking an “Upvote” button on a card will increase its
				upvoteCount and visually update the card.
			</li>
			<li>
				A small form that lets visitors add a new idea for this session only.
				Submitting the form will push a new object into the ideas array and
				re-render the list.
			</li>
			<li>
				Conditional messages, such as a “No ideas match your filters” notice when
				appropriate, and a highlight (badge or icon) for popular ideas above a
				certain upvote threshold.
			</li>
			<li>
				At least one relevant image or icon that symbolizes brainstorming,
				collaboration, or feature requests.
			</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				Need to work more on this. This whole project is just a place holder for somthing
				else Ive been working on. It is a wough draft to say the least.
			</p>
			<img src="images/bad home wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />
			<p>
				<a href="https://wireframe.cc/pro/ppp/beb3acd13-994496" target="_blank">View Home Wireframe</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				
				and 
				https://wireframe.cc/pro/editor/994496?pageId=6f3d4210-a99e-45ac-a07a-fd4d1dbf64ca

				This page would be used for usered to input and share ideas for features as well as
				well as usecases for the software.  Users would be able to upvote ideas and sort 
				them based on as well as upload possible files.
